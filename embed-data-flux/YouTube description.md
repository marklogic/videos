Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning, allowing AI systems to understand and compare content based on context rather than just keywords. MarkLogic Flux can generate these vector embeddings for your documents, enabling you to build powerful AI applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using MarkLogic Server's vector query capabilities.

This video demonstrates how to generate vector embeddings using MarkLogic Flux with the MiniLM model, including examples of Base64 encoding and custom prompts for domain-specific embeddings.
